<h1>Universal Analytics image to click tracking</h1>
<p>This is a demo of how you can use Google Analytics to track opens of an email using an image that when loads, triggers a hit to GA, and then be able to link that image hit with a later session that clicks through to view and possibly convert.</p>
<p>Applications include email tracking and affiliate sales tracking.</p>
<p>To use:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Upload an image you would like to appear.  This can be any .png, including a 1x1 pixel.</li>
	<li>Construct the URL for the event you would like to track. cid=uniqueId, if you include p=1 it will track as a virtual pageview (so be able to be used in GA funnels), c=campaign name<li>
	<li>If you use p=1, it will record opens under '/vpv/email-view/' (+ campaign from c if present)</li>
	<li>The cid parameter will construct the anonymous ID for GA to link sessions together.  It can be text or a number. An email address works - example: cid=mark@wunderman.com</li>
	<li>Put that URL as where the image is loaded from.  It has to "hotlink" the image, if it loads via a CDN it won't work (e.g. if you load the image into Twitter, Facebook etc. they save it on their own servers</li>
	<li>Every view of that image URL will result in a hit in GA.  Send it in an email.</li>
	<li>To link sessions, the landing page should be setup to accept the cid.  An example is available at <a href="/landing-page">this location</a></li>
	<li>Any links in the email (or the image) that land on the landing page with the same cid as above (e.g. cid=mark@edmondson.com) will be linked to the image view session.  Put utm_campaign etc. parameters on there as well if you like</li>
</ol>
<p>The Current Image:

<a href="/upload-image">Upload New Image</a>
